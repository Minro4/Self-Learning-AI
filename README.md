# Self-Learning-AI
Reinforcement learning AI for turn based 1 on 1 games.

Currently uses a neural network model to evaluate the quality of a position and has multiple tree traversal algorithm implemeted like MCST and MiniMax.
Checkers nn model works pretty well but the chess one needs a lot of improvement and could benefit from a nn for better tree traversal.
